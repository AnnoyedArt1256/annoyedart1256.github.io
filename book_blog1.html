<h3 id="my-thoughts">My Thoughts</h3>
<p>This book includes neither a happy beginning nor a happy ending, thus this book is written in a pessimistic style and since the writer said this information in the beginning of the book, I was not surprised at all about the ending although it wasn’t as bad as I expected. The plot flow was pretty good and the characters are so realistic that I sympathized with the characters a lot. Speaking of characters…</p>

<summary>The Baudelaire Children</summary>
<details>
<summary>Violet</summary> She is fourteen years old, thus she is the oldest of the main heroes, and she is interested in inventing and building strange devices.
</details>
<pre><code>&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Klaus&lt;/summary&gt;
He is the middle child of the Baudelaire family. He is also the only boy of the family. He liked to examine creature in tide-pools. He wears glasses and he is intelligent.
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Sunny&lt;/summary&gt;
She is the youngest of the bunch and she likes to bite things. Since she is an infant, she can&#39;t talk yet so she can only speak through shreaks that sound like gibberish.
&lt;/details&gt;</code></pre>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Count Olaf</summary> He is the new parent of the Baudelaire children, and boy is he abusive. He is either a third cousin four times removed, or a fourth cousin three times removed of the Baudelarie’s. For example, he only allows for one bed for all three children which means that one child sleeps in the bed, and the other two have to sleep on the hard wooden floor.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Justice Strauss</summary> She is a next-door neighbor to Count Olaf, but she isn’t abusive, she’s the exact opposite! She has a very big and nice private library. Strauss also works as a lawyer.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Mr. Poe</summary> Mr. Poe was a friend of the Baudelaire’s parents which the children have met multiple times.
</details>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>While the three Baudelaire children were at the beach, Mr. Poe appeared and said that their parents had died in a fire. They then got carried to Count Olaf, who was a relative of the three, but there’s a twist. Count Olaf is <strong>very abusive</strong> to the Baudelaire children. He calls them “orphans”, he only allows for <strong>one</strong> bed for all three children which means that the children have to sleep in the singular bed a la <strong>round-robin</strong>, he forces the children to cook a meal for a group of ten… Count Olaf also has friends from his theater trope which are also abusive. <br> <br> The three children of course didn’t want to live this way, so they seeked out revenge. They used plans such as working around Count Olaf’s abusive words (specifically marrying Violet) to get him detained. They used Justic Strauss’ (Olaf’s next door neighbor) large library to read books about nupital law, but none of these plans worked. Count Olaf took notice of these plans and he tried to counter them. For example he put Sunny (the youngest child of the three) in a cage and threatened the other two children that she would be dropped from above if they don’t comply with Count Olaf with things like saying yes to Count Olaf’s marriage with Violet <strong>legally</strong> in a theatrical play. <br> <br> Once the play actually started and during the marriage people realized that Violet is a kid, they started to get mad at Count Olaf because of the law. Count Olaf then said that this was a legal marriage, which made things worse, but after realizing that Violet is <strong>right-handed</strong> and she put down her signature with her <strong>left hand</strong>, everyone realized that this wasn’t actually a legal marriage since she has to write her signature using her <strong>dominant hand</strong>, thus Count Olaf got arrested. When Mr. Poe heard about this fuss, he decided to drive the Baudelaire children to another relative who will care for them now. When they last saw Justice Strauss the children got very sad, because she was a very nice and kind woman.</p>
